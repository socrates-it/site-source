    <p>Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are sad to announce that SoCraTes IT 2020 is cancelled.</p>

## Location
We are going to be in the hotel, night and day. That is why we have chosen the [Hotel Sporting Rimini](https://www.hotelsportingrimini.com/) in [Rimini (RN)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Sporting+Rimini/@44.0692481,12.5777186,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!3m7!1s0x132cc3771484e347:0xa0d37c9d07777d6b!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d44.0692443!4d12.5799073) as our location for the unconference.

Since one of the important aspects of SoCraTes is being close to the “action”, everything will happen within the location: lodging, eating and mingling. As a result, we can only accept as many participants as the number of available rooms!

## What is included in the cost?

* **Two nights full-board**: breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack buffet all day (vegetarian and gluten-free food included!)
* Use of the congress rooms
* The hotel has both twin and double rooms. If there is someone you are willing to share the room with, feel free to book the double room. If you don’t know anyone, don’t worry: sign in to the Sofware Crafters #italian channel on Slack and find a suitable roommate.
* City tax

## Why is the cost variable?

SoCraTes IT is a no-profit event, which implies that the exact cost of a ticket will depend on the amount of sponsorship we receive. All the sponsorship money will cover the cost of the congress rooms. It could be also used to offer extra amenities during the conference or to reduce the ticket prices for all participants.
