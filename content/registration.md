    <p>Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are sad to announce that SoCraTes IT 2020 is cancelled.</p>
    <p>For refunds, we kindly invite you to get in contact with <a href="https://www.alpholiday.it/" target="_blank">AlpHoliday Dolomiti Wellness &amp; Fun Hotel.</a></p>
</div>

## Location
We are going to be in the hotel, night and day. That is why, we have chosen the [AlpHoliday Dolomiti Wellness & Fun Hotel](https://www.alpholiday.it/) in Dimaro (Trento) as our location for the unconference.

Since one of the important aspects of SoCraTes is being close to the “action”, everything will happen within
the location: lodging, eating and mingling. As a result, we can only accept as many participants as the
number of available beds.
